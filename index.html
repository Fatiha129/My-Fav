              I like coding alot! i took classes of it and i'm on my 59 class! i started at around october and i have been doing it for about 9 months! i only take classes on the weekends because of school, but i still love doing it!
              At first it was pretty easy but now since the basics are done it's getting kind of hard, and i have like 4 project not done. But i'm sure i finish them before their due date. (hopefully)
